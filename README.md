# 22/27-tmdb-designed

This project is all about creating a nicely ddesigned TMDB (the movie database)

This will be a full stack project, will build frontend as well as api which can
be used independently. I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to
initiate the project and will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) and for
styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with
[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). also will use
[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) api to fetch latest weather
data.
